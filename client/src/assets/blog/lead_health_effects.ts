  content: `<div>While the harmful effects of lead weren’t always understood, 
  health experts today agree that there is 
    <a 
      href='/history-lead'>no safe level</a> of lead in your blood. Fetuses, 
    infants and young children are at the greatest risk for the adverse effects 
    of lead poisoning. Young children absorb lead faster and more easily than 
    older children and adults, however anyone exposed to lead through 
    swallowing it, breathing it in, or absorbing it is at risk for health 
    issues. While LeadOut looks closely at lead in water pipes, lead can also 
    be 
    <a 
      href='https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/protect-your-tap-quick-check-lead-0'>
      found</a> in paint, dust, soil, air, and food. </div>
  <div>The greater the exposure level to lead, the more risk there is for 
    damage to the bones, teeth, blood, liver, kidneys and brain. Exposure risk 
    continues after first contact, as lead is stored in the bones where it can 
    be a source of continuous internal exposure.</div>
  <div>The health problems caused by lead are 
    <a 
      href='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/health.html'>varied</a>, 
    which is why they can be easily mistaken for other illnesses. <b><i>Short 
    term lead exposure symptoms include:</i></b>
    <ul>
      <li>Abdominal pain</li>
      <li>Constipation</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Headache</li>
      <li>Irritability</li>
      <li>Loss of appetite</li>
      <li>Memory loss</li>
      <li>Pain or tingling in the hands or feet</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Long term effects of lead poisoning are even more serious. In children, 
  lead exposure

    can lead to</a>: damage to the brain and nervous system, behavior and 
    learning disabilities, delays in physical and mental development, slowed 
    growth and hearing disorders. Pregnant women and fetuses are also at 
    increased risk of health issues and lead exposure can cause reduced fetal 
    growth and premature birth. While adults can tolerate higher levels of lead 
    than children, they can also suffer from adverse effects to the heart, 
    kidneys, blood, and reproductive organs.</div>
  <div>If you or your child is experiencing lead poisoning symptoms, contact 
    your health provider to talk about getting a blood test for lead.</div>
  <div>LeadOut helps you understand your area’s risk for lead in your water 
    pipes. If your risk level is high, contact your water facility or city to 
    ask about getting your water tested. Some areas may have free or low cost 
    water tests available. In the meantime, you may want to consider getting a
