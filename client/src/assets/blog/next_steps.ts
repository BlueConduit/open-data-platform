  content: `<p>Learning that your area is at medium or high risk for lead may sound
    concerning, however, there are a number of steps you can take immediately to
    protect yourself to feel secure in your home once again. </p>
  <p>The first thing you should know is that testing your water for lead is the
    only way to know if your water is truly lead-free. Some areas offer free or
    subsidized <a

    water testing </a> from their city or local water utility, and other areas
    may charge a fee. To find out the situation in your neighborhood, call your
    local water utility service. Your provider may be listed in your status on
    LeadOut or can usually be found with a quick Google search. Once you
    determine if there are lead pipes leading into your home, your water utility
    or a licensed plumber can help you determine options for getting pipes
    replaced. Depending on what part of the piping contains lead, some areas
    have free replacement programs. Look on your city’s website or call their
    help line to learn about your options. </p>
  <p>Whether you confirm for sure that your water contains lead or you
    just want to play it safe, you can drink bottled water, which is a less
    cost-effective solution over time, or use a water filter. Using a
    lead-removing water filter is the best way to know you are drinking clean,
    safe water from your tap. There are many different kinds of filters at
    different price ranges. Learn more about the best kind of filter for your
    situation here, and also ask your city or local water utility if there are
    any free filter programs in your area. </p>
  <p>While using a water filter or having your pipes replaced are the only true
    solutions to remove lead from your water, there are a few actions you can
    take <a
      href='https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/basic-information-about-lead-drinking-water#:~:text=drinking%20water.-,Important%20Steps%20You%20Can%20Take%20to%20Reduce%20Lead%20in%20Drinking%20Water,-Have%20your%20water'>
      according to the EPA</a> that may help reduce your lead exposure in the
    short term. </p>
  <p>Running your taps, or “flushing” your water system is a short-term
    option. The evidence on flushing is mixed, but longer flushes have the
    potential to reduce exposure to water that has been in contact with lead
    pipes overnight. Contact your water utility to learn more about flushing
    times in your area. Second, use cold water for drinking, cooking, and making
    baby formula, as higher temperature water may contain more lead. Boiling
    water does not remove lead, and may make the lead concentration higher!
    Remember, you cannot see, taste, or smell lead dissolved in water. Learn
    more about common lead myths here. Finally, you can clean your faucet’s
    screen (also called an aerator). Lead particles can collect in the screen
    and contaminate your water. </p>
  <p>Remember, if you suspect or find out you have lead in your water supply,
    your best bet until pipes can be replaced is to invest in a filter. This
    simple step can bring back your confidence in your drinking water.</p>`,
