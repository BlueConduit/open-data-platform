  content: `<p>While replacing your water pipes entirely is the best way to 
    protect yourself from known lead sources (contact your local water utility 
    to find out options!), using a water filter is the next best way to keep 
    your family safe. In this post, we’ll break down some of the options for 
    water filters to help you find the best one for your home. </p>
  <p>How do you decide what type of filter will work best in your home? First, 
    let’s define what filters actually do. Water filters remove unwanted 
    impurities from the water like particles, minerals and bacteria. Make sure 
    that the water filter you choose to use is certified by a certifying agency 
    such as the NSF or the WQA  and that they meet Standard 53, for lead. This 
    certification confirms the filter

      will effectively remove lead.</a></p>
  <p>The 4 types of water filters LeadOut recommends are listed below, as well 
    as their average pricing, life span and other important fact you need to be 
    aware of in order to be able to make an informed decision on which water 
    filter best suits your home and lifestyle: </p>

        <b>A pitcher</b>
        <p>Pitchers are an easy and budget-friendly solution for filtering your
         water. These filters

         remove</a> metals like lead, copper, and mercury as 
         well as chemicals like chlorine and pesticides. They can also remove 
         organic compounds that affect the taste and smell of water. 
         <b>Important:</b> Make sure the filter you select is designed to 
         remove lead. You can check for a

            certification mark</a> to verify.</p>
         <ul>
          <li><b>Cost:</b> Between $40 - $140</li>
          <li><b>Life Span:</b> Filters usually need to be replaced every 2 to 4
           months (depending on the water quality and usage of the pitcher)</li>
          <li>
            <b>Keep in Mind:</b> Pitchers are easy to use and work well on a 
            budget, though filter replacements may add up over time. 
            Additionally, the actual filtering of the water may take some time.

        <b>On-tap/Faucet Filters</b>
        <p>On-tap or faucet-mounted filters are one of the easiest and cheapest 
        ways to filter your water. Both practical and efficient, they can be a 
        great long-term solution in the home.</p>
         <ul>
          <li><b>Cost:</b> Between $20 - $50</li>
          <li><b>Life Span:</b> Filters usually need to be replaced every 2 to 3
           months (depending on the water quality and usage of the tap)</li>
          <li><b>Keep in Mind:</b> Faucet filters are great because they don’t 
          require any wait time to use. Keep in mind, they may reduce the water 
          pressure and can be awkward to fit and keep sealed. Make sure to 
          replace the filters regularly and to check the label to see the 
          guidelines, as some filters are not meant to be used with hot water.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <li>
        <b>Under-Sink Filter</b>
        <p>Under-sink 
          <a 
            href='https://www.springwellwater.com/under-sink-water-filters-a-good-investment/'>
            systems</a> provide filtered drinking water on demand, with no 
            waiting around for the filtration process to run its course. This is
             ideal if you have a big family or use lots of water a day. They 
             save counter space and don’t require filter replacements as often 
             as water pitchers.</p>
         <ul>
          <li><b>Cost:</b> $50 - $250</li>
          <li><b>Life Span:</b> 6 to 12 months depending on usage (usually 
          replace after 1000 gallons of water)</li>
          <li><b>Keep in Mind:</b> Under-sink systems are more expensive than 
          pitcher filters, even with a longer filter life span. Additionally, 
          installation may require a plumber.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        <b>Household Filtration Systems</b>
        <p>A household filtration system is the best 
          <a
            href='https://www.plumbingplus.net/blog/2018/december/is-a-water-filtration-system-really-worth-the-in/#:~:text=So%20the%20answer%20is%2C%20yes,vendors%20for%20an%20affordable%20price.'>
            option</a> for those that can afford the higher price tag. These 
            systems treat water where the main water line enters the home, 
            ensuring the water that flows from every faucet, every showerhead, 
            and even in your washing machine, is clean and filtered.</p>
         <ul>
          <li><b>Cost:</b> $1000 - $4000 (excluding plumbing costs)</li>
          <li><b>Life Span:</b> 3 to 10 years (but filter needs to be replaced 
          every 3 - 6 months)</li>
          <li><b>Keep in Mind:</b> Household systems can decrease the need for 
          regular plumbing maintenance in your home because they reduce the 
          amount of sediment and rust found in water, which causes equipment 
          malfunctions and wears down pipes and tanks over time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        <b>Shower Filters</b>
        <p>While you won’t absorb lead from showering in lead-contaminated water
        , using a lead-removing shower filter will ensure you (or your 
        children) don’t accidentally swallow the water. Buying a shower filter 
        should be prioritized last over the filters for your drinking water. 
        </p>
         <ul>
          <li><b>Cost:</b> $20 - $60 (depending if filter or replacing shower 
          head)</li>
          <li><b>Life Span:</b> 6 months</li>
          <li><b>Keep in Mind:</b>  A shower filter is great when used in 
          combination with a water pitcher or sink filter, however having 
          multiple filters can be an expensive solution in the long term.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p>If you think you may be exposed to lead through your drinking water, 
      apply a water filter to all faucets where drinking water is coming from 
      or purify it with a pitcher filter. Water filters have proven to be very 
      effective to remove lead from your drinking water. Importantly, make sure 
      to check for lead certifications and take proper care of your filters. In 
      general, do not run hot water through pitcher filters. Make sure to 
      install sink or household filters properly and replace the filters on 
      schedule. Read the directions of your certified filter to make sure you 
      install and replace it correctly. </p>

      contact your water utility or licensed plumber for advice. </p>
