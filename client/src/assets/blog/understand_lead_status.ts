  <p>You might be wondering how LeadOut determines your area’s risk status.
    There’s actually a lot that goes into it. To create the tool, water
    analytics company BlueConduit teamed up with fellows from Google.org to
    intake and process a lot of data, calculating a risk statuses for certain
    areas. The things the team looked at were home age, a measurement called the
    Area Deprivation Index(ADI), and income level. Keep reading for an
    explanation of how all of these relate to your lead risk status.</p>

    them (and there are two areas – pipes that go directly into your
    home and also pipes in the street!), home age can help determine your risk
    status for lead, because older homes are at a higher risk for lead pipes. If
    your home’s original plumbing was built before 1986 (when lead in the US was

    from plumbing use), the pipes or the shoulders connecting them are
    more likely than newer plumbing to be made of lead. Keep in mind, it’s not
    always just the pipes that affect your water supply – lead could also be
    hiding in your faucets and other fixtures. </p>
  <div class='h2-header'>Area Deprivation Index (ADI)</div>
  <p>This index is a number based on <a
    href='https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/'>17 categories</a>
    that are used to describe socioeconomic disadvantage based on income,
    education, household characteristics, and housing created by the Health
    Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). ADIs are often used to
    determine risks for your health caused by your environment. </p>
  <div class='h2-header'>Income Level</div>
  <p>Income levels are also a determining factor in lead risk.The income level
    for your area is based upon census data and does not reflect each
    household’s actual income. Because homes in lower-income areas are likely to
    be older and less likely to have been renovated, lead risk increases in
    areas where income is lower.
  </p>
  <p>Lead risk is a tricky number to pin down and doesn’t determine if you
    absolutely do or do not have lead pipes, however, those in a high risk
    status should consider getting their water tested by a professional or
    buying a filter and should be on the lookout for lead poisoning symptoms. A
    good first step is calling your water utility to learn more about the
    options available to you.
