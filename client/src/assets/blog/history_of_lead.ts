  content: `<p>You may have heard that lead exposure is dangerous, so how did 
    it end up in our water systems? </p>
  <p>Lead is a toxic metal that is harmful to human health, but it wasn’t always
    seen as dangerous. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, before the dangers of
    lead were fully documented,
    <a
      href='https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/basic-information-about-lead-drinking-water'>
      many cities in the USA installed lead water pipes </a>.
    In some cities, use of lead water pipes was even required by the
    local government due to the material’s durability. Because lead water pipes
    can last up to a century, many cities today still have their original pipes
    in place. Today, lead is recognized as a significant health risk. There is
    no concentration of lead in the human body that is considered “safe” as it
    is known to cause neurological damage as well as varying other dangerous
    health outcomes. </p>
  <p>The issue of lead in drinking water is widespread. Lead service lines are
    likely in use in every US state. The US Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) has estimated that there are currently
    <a
      href='https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/basic-information-about-lead-drinking-water'>6
      to 10 million</a> lead service lines across the country.</p>
  <p>
    One of the biggest challenges with finding and replacing lead water pipes is
    that it’s difficult to know exactly which pipes contain lead. Before
    electronic records, cities recorded information about their water systems in
    varying levels of detail. Records of pipe locations and materials used in
    the last century are often inaccurate, lack description, or have even been
    lost over time. Because the information isn’t readily accessible,
    BlueConduit works hard to make this information accessible to water
    utilities and to the general public through LeadOut. Through predictive
    modeling and persevering on the quest for more data, they’re able to add
    information to LeadOut over time.
  </p>
  <p>Once found, replacing lead pipes is generally expensive and time consuming.
    While many cities and water systems are working to remove known lead from
    their infrastructure, LeadOut helps affected communities take action for
    their health. The first steps are easy - calling your local utility company
    to learn about water testing, ordering a filter, and educating yourself
    about lead poisoning symptoms.</p>`,
