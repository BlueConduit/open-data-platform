## Project Management

The system architecture is [roughly outlined here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO5fQW04=/), which breaks the project down into several sub-projects. Each sub-project has [a tag in Shortcut](https://app.shortcut.com/blueconduit/labels?SearchQuery=google.org&Sort=Label_NAME), prefixed with `Google.org`. Work is done in sprints, [visible here](https://app.shortcut.com/blueconduit/stories/space/3689/google-org-sprint).
