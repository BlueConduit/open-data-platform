# LeadOut

12 Million US households, mostly in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods, live in homes with
contaminated drinking water supplied from lead pipes and are unable to get the lead out, mainly due
to lack of awareness and easy access to information on lead pipes and the remediation plan.

LeadOut aims to empower residents to help get the lead out of their homes and communities by
creating awareness and easy access to simple, reliable, relevant information on lead pipes and best
actions.

**LeadOut is a software tool where residents can see predictive likelihood to have lead water
service lines in their home, neighborhood, or water system.**
